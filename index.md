# Welcome!

Hey there! I'm Boxeh/Suvan, and I develop cool stuff using JavaScript. You can find details of my projects on this page, as well as contact details, should you need them.

## Languages

I mainly have experience in two programming languages - JavaScript and Python. I am familiar with the basics of Python, and I am looking to get back into it soon, despite having not touched it for over 3 years. Being able to use both JavaScript and Python will enable me to work on a much wider range of projects, as each language has its own common uses.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Boxeh/boxeh.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

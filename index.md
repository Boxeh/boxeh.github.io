# Welcome!

Hey there! I'm Boxeh/Suvan, and I develop cool stuff using JavaScript. You can find details of my projects on this page, as well as contact details, should you need them.

## Languages

I mainly have experience in two programming languages - JavaScript and Python. I am familiar with the basics of Python, and I am looking to get back into it soon, despite having not touched it for over 3 years. Being able to use both JavaScript and Python will enable me to work on a much wider range of projects, as each language has its own common uses.

# Current projects

## JavaScript
### Discord Bot Application (delet)
I am currently developing a Bot for the widely used [Discord App](https://discordapp.com/), a communication platform for gamers.
As stated in the [documentation for this project](https://github.com/Boxeh/delet-docs):

>The "delet" bot aims to provide a simplistic yet functional and effective moderation system as well as solutions to keep the guild as interactive and enjoyable a place as possible. If you're anti-fun, a feature may be added in the future (once the bot is public) to disable certain command categories locally.

A common issue in large Discord guilds (guilds are called 'servers' within the client) is fast, efficient moderation. This bot provides exactly what is missing. For example, users can quickly and easily be banned through a no-nonsense system. The bot additionally carries features that are not currently within Discord itself - such as channel lockdowns and the ability to issue warnings to users.

The [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages used in this project can be found in the `package.json` file, **[here](https://github.com/Boxeh/delet-docs/blob/master/package.json)**.

Once this bot is complete, all the code will be completely open source, and will be in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Boxeh/).
This application/bot uses the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) library.

### Custom Interactive Website
More information and documentation on this soonâ„¢. ðŸ˜‰

## Python
### No current projects... for now!
I do not have any current projects that use Python, although I will be starting on one soon! This will be updated with a lot more information once I start it.
